# BooruViewer

A basic image viewer app for a popular image board Sankaku (NSFW) that I made as an exploration of SwiftUI and [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

## Features

- Native peek & pop
- Recommended posts
- Tag search
- Filters
- Image caching

## Setup

- Download this project.
- Open in Xcode (tested with version 14.3).
- Build and run.

**Note:** The app is built with `SAFE_MODE` compiler flag by default, which prevents any NSFW content from showing up by showing pictures of cats instead as seen in the demo. To bypass this behaviour, just remove the flag in app's Build Settings.
